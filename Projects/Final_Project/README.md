# Final Project



Hints on what should go into this page (note each three of these sections are weighted evenly):

### Definition of problem being solved 
(project overview, research question, data available, outcomes anticipated, application design) 

### Documentation of experiments and results 
(model training results, description of training runs, model architecture choices, visual record of experiments) 

### Critical reflection and learning from experiments 
(observations from experiments, factors incluencing results, potential improvements, weaknesses, feedback from reviews) 



### Note: 
*You can choose what tools you use to write up and document your project - your final submission will be a pdf document being uploaded via Moodle, however we would also expect to see a link through to your GitHub repository where you data, results etc. are documented.*

## Introduction
Clouds play a crucial role in our daily lives, affecting everything from the weather to the climate. Cloud types have an impact of Earth's energy balance (Hartmann, L, D., Ockert-Bell, M. and Michelsen, L, M., 1992) and global radiation.  (Chen, T., Rossow, B, W. and Zhang, Y., 2000). Thus, understanding cloud is an important task in environmental monitoring and meteorology to improve weather prediction and assessing climate models. Thus, understanding cloud is an important task in environmental monitoring and meteorology to improve weather prediction and assessing climate models. This project will explore the use of Deep Learning models to automatically classify and identify different types of clouds based on ground-based cloud images. 

Luke Howard in 1802 proposed cloud classification into three types, Cirrus, Cumulus & Stratus. And then World Meteorological Organizations (WMO) extended Luke Howard's idea to group cloud types into three levels, namely low level (CL), middle level (CM), and high level (CH). Each of these groups is further divided into 10 cloud types based on the International Cloud Atlas Weather Meteorological Organizations. (World Meteorological Organizations, 1975). This project will only focus on the three types of cloud based on height level with additional of Contrail.

Until now, observations of cloud types by meteorologists are still mostly done manually using the human eye. Even though the human eye can recognize cloud types well, there are still many differences of opinion among meteorologists in recognizing cloud types. This is where Deep learning methods come into play, as they can automatically extract features from cloud images and classify them.Some Deep Learning method use cloud images from satelite data (Cai, K. and Wang, H., 2017) (Guo, Y. et al., 2020) for cloud classification, while others use ground-based cloud images captured by instruments like the total sky imager (Zhu, T., Liang, W. and Guo, Y., 2021).
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify different types of clouds based on ground-based cloud images 


## Research Question
Can cloud be classified on real-time event based on the images input by leveraging a deep learning model on an edge device (like mobilephone) ?

## Application Overview
This project will try to classify cloud into 3 types of cloud plus additional of contrail, the condensation trail that is left behind by a passing jet plane. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify different types of clouds based on ground-based cloud images. The image input is a picture taken on the smartphone by using a Flutter based application with Tensorflow library installed. Tensorflow model will run on the Flutter app, and detect and classify image on the go. Deep learning model is built, trained and converted to the Tensorflow lite model in the Google Colab environment.

## Data
Initially, CCSN dataset (Cirrus cumulus stratus nimbus (CCSN) database, 2019) which classify cloud into 10 types + 1 contrail is being collected. For simplicity and as a prove concet of Deep Learning, this dataset is modified, merging some cloud types into 3 types of cloud based on their height level with contrail picture is added. A little inspection was done to check and remove for dirty picture, where there is too much additional 'information' on the cloud picture such as building or landscape. This cleaning step is crucial as the project would like to deploy a deep learning model in the real condition.

<p align="center">Figure 3. Datasets</p>

Regarding the total pictures for the 4 categories, there is a data imbalance between cloud images and contrail images. There are 900 images of each cloud type and fewer than 300 contrail images when this dataset was first downloaded. For this reason, I looked for additional datasets from the image repository, such as flickr.com. By using code from [pyimgdata](https://github.com/jeffheaton/pyimgdata) (Heaton, 2020) which was developed by [Jeff Heaton](https://www.heatonresearch.com/), I can bulk download images from Flickr by using spesific keyword and save the images to my Google Colab environment. The final datasets contain 600 pictures of each type of cloud and contrail, so it was 2400 images in total. The data was further split into 60% (360x4 images) for the training dataset, 20% (120x4 images) for validation and 20% (120x4 images) for testing.



## Model
25 models were developed to get the best accuracy from the testing sessions. 3 models based on Keras framework were developed to find out the best results for classifying clouds. The first is Keras sequential model, the second is Transfer Learning, and the last is Fine-tuning a pre-trained model. From the experimental results described in the table below, it can be seen that VGG16 with epoch 64 has the best performance in terms of accuracy. Further tested parameters for VGG16 will be described in the next section. For the refinement model based on VGG16, it was found that the experiments did not bring significant improvements in validation and testing accuracy. It can be difficult to find the best number of layers to retrain. More experiments are needed to explore this model. Due to limited time for project work, VGG16-based transfer learning was chosen because it gave the best results even though the accuracy was below 75%. More performance metrics can be found in this section.

This is the summary of experiments done in this project. The best parameters were choosen based on the accuracy.

## Experiments
The experiment focused on the VGG16 on epoch 64 model which was proven to have the best accuracy results in the previous testing session. More experiments were conducted on this model to explore more possibilites to obtain better accuracy. The experiments focused on optimizing the number of batch size, optimizer and learning type
- Batch Size : The selection of batch size affects the update of weights and bias. Smaller batch size would give result lesser samples and bigger batch size give more samples. I evaluate two batch sizes, 32 and 64, based on the accuracy scores. From this experiment,  batch size 64 did not bring any improvement.

- Optimizer: I tried to experiment with different optimizer with the learning rate and batch size 0.001 and 64 respectively. The optimizer evaluated on the basis of accuracy score. The table below depicts the accuracy score of different optimizers. The result shows that adam was still the best choice for optimizer

- Epoch Size : The epoch size is being selected as a parameter to tweak the models. The choice is 16, 32, and 64. Table below details how this epoch can make a higher accuracy for the project

## Testing on real-world
Experiment conducted by deploying the Tensor Flow model on a mobile phone based on the Flutter application. There are several reasons why mobile phones are chosen over microcontrollers. First, a mobile application that is integrated with a Deep Learning model can be developed to be able to take pictures or use photos from the internet to quickly differentiate cloud types. Users can immediately take out their mobile phone and point it at the sky to find out what types of clouds they don't recognize directly. Second, considering the complexity of the image classification model, mobile phones have advantages in terms of storing complex models, rapid inference and high resolution photo capabilities. Real-world experiments show that the application can work during the day.

## Results and Observations
1. Data Collection
Datasets is limited, user have to add his own datasets
2. Model and experiment**
Cloud type is difficult to classify because there are too many noise in the picture
Too many class is not really good for a simple Deep Learning with limited resource to build this app
3. Real world application**
The accuracy for below <75 is quite low, so it is difficult to classify cloud in realtime

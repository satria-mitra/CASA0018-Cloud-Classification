## Introduction
Clouds play a crucial role in our daily lives, affecting everything from the weather to the climate. Cloud types have an impact of Earth's energy balance (Hartmann, L, D., Ockert-Bell, M. and Michelsen, L, M., 1992) and global radiation.  (Chen, T., Rossow, B, W. and Zhang, Y., 2000). Thus, understanding cloud is an important task in environmental monitoring and meteorology to improve weather prediction and assessing climate models. Thus, understanding cloud is an important task in environmental monitoring and meteorology to improve weather prediction and assessing climate models. This project will explore the use of Deep Learning models to automatically classify and identify different types of clouds based on ground-based cloud images. 

Cloud types are divided into 4 large groups, namely low level, middle level, and nimbus cloud. Each of these groups is further divided into 10 cloud types based on the International Cloud Atlas Weather Meteorological Organizations. (World Meteorological Organizations, 1975)




## Research Question
Can cloud be classified on real-time event based on the images input by leveraging a deep learning model on an edge device (like mobilephone) ?

## Application Overview
This project will try to classify cloud into 10 types of cloud plus additional of contrail, the condensation trail that is left behind by a passing jet plane. The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify different types of clouds based on ground-based cloud images. The image input is a picture taken on the smartphone by using a Flutter based application with Tensorflow library installed. Tensorflow model will run on the Flutter app, and detect and classify image on the go. Deep learning model is built, trained and converted to the Tensorflow lite model in the Google Colab environment. 



## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
